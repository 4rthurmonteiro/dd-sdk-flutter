# Changelog

* Cancel spans on DatadogTrackingHttpClient when RUM is enabled (prevent spans
  from leaking native resources)
* Remove native view tracking (Activities and Fragments) from Android by default
* Add support for creating multiple named loggers: `DatadogSdk.createLogger` and
  `LoggingConfiguration.loggerName`
* Add support for configuring whether loggers send data to Datadog:

  replaced with a standalone `datadog_tracking_http_client` package.

  longer defaults to `DatadogSite.us1`
